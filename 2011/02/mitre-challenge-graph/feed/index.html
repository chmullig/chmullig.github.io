		<description><![CDATA[No way, Riffraff was Catalist? That&#039;s hilarious. If you still talk to Brauner, ask him about me and Polimetrix&#039; matching technology... that&#039;s what powered the yougov team.

When they changed the site at the beta I never updated my code to compensate due to lack of time. Unfortunately the only way I got my data was my scrapping the site every hour, there was no record I could find that listed everything retroactively. The scale seems to have changed as well. Perhaps the MITRE folks will release data for me to use. I&#039;ll send them an email about it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Now that you mention it...it would definitely be cool to translate my code to clojure or scala.  Maybe when I post it I&#039;ll do that.

I think I am one good idea away from cracking 80...that would be a big psychological hurdle for me.  At the moment I&#039;ve hit a wall at 79 though.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Cool! We&#039;re using lots of custom python, much of which uses Jaro/Jaro-Winkler as the distance metric, but certainly not all. 

Unfortunately the code was built for an entirely different purpose, mostly 4-5 years ago now. It&#039;s aged well, but I think to get much further I&#039;ll need to actually look at the dataset and tune/write some code.]]></description>
