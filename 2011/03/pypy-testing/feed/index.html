		<description><![CDATA[I spent some time playing around with this and optimizing (I altered it to run everything 3x).  I started at 8s for CPython, and a tad less for PyPy.  Now I&#039;m down to 6s for CPython and 4.5s for PyPy (none of my optimizations were aimed at CPython, they just happened to help there as well).  The changes I made are pretty simple http://paste.pocoo.org/show/358164/, although invasive.  The issue is when comparing a unicode string to a byte string you have to check the defaultencoding in case it&#039;s set to something crazy.  There&#039;s still more work to be done (mostly on PyPy itself), but this rights the situation a bit.]]></description>
