## About

Howdy, I'm Chris. I live in Brooklyn, NY with my wonderful fiance and ridiculous cat.

I recently graduated from Columbia's School of General Studies with a Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science, where I focused on machine learning. I'm still at Columbia, where I'm finishing a Master of Arts in Statistics. I spent 4 semesters as a TA for COMS 3157 Advanced Programming, a great class that teaches C, systems programming, UNIX, networking/sockets, and C++. This semester I'm a TA for STAT 4400 Statistical Machine Learning. I also cofounded and have run the Columbia Data Science Society.

Before I went to Columbia I spent seven years in political data and survey research, mostly at YouGov. While at Columbia I've done data internships at Kickstarter, Facebook, and The New York Times.

On the rare occassions I'm able to slip away I enjoy exploring the world and being mediocre at punishing video games like KSP. I'm a bit young to have seen a Saturn V launch, but hopefully I'll be able to see Falcon Heavy and SLS soon.
