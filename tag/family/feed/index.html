				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Apparently today is a good day to do historic stuff. The first piece of usenet/email spam was posted; the first space shuttle, Columbia, was first launched; Yuri Gagarin was the first person in space; FDR died; and the Civil War began with the battle of Fort Sumter. (and my cousin (once removed) was baptized!) Through the happenstance of fate an ancestor of mine, Dr. Lebby, was present there and wrote up an account. My dad dug it out of Google Books, they helpfully scanned and OCR&#8217;d it for us.</p>
<p><!-- p.p1 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 10.0px Consolas} p.p2 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 10.0px Consolas; min-height: 12.0px} span.s1 {text-decoration: underline ; color: #134fae} -->Reading about the anniversary, my dad looked up <em><a href="http://books.google.com/books?ei=nJKkTYyID5GH0QGE94X0CA&amp;ct=result&amp;id=2_IwAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=Nathaniel+Lebby%2C+patriot%3A+and+some+of+his+descendants&amp;q=Fort+Sumter#search_anchor">Nathaniel Lebby, Patriot, And Some of his Descendants</a></em> by Edmund Detreville Ellis (my great grandfather) and found that there was a reference on p. 170. He typed the excerpt from his paper copy:</p>
<blockquote><p>My parents were married in the official residence of the Quarantine Officer of the State of South Carolina and the Port of Charleston, Dr. Robert Lebby, Jr., on January 29, 1889 &#8211; my grandfather Lebby&#8217;s 58th birthday &#8211; by Rev. Josiah McL. Seabrook. The house is still standing and is occupied by a Doctor and his family!  It is only a few hundred yards from where Dr. Lebby, in his capacity as Physician, stood when &#8220;The First Shot&#8221; was fired from Fort Johnson on Fort Sumter on April 12, 1861! He later wrote an account of that historic event.</p></blockquote>
<p>My dad found <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=d0kUAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA141&amp;dq=Robert+Lebby+Fort+Sumter&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=xIakTd-PLITp0gGzocX9CA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Robert%20Lebby%20Fort%20Sumter&amp;f=false">the account</a>, in <em>The South Carolina historical and genealogical magazine, Volume 12.</em> A plaintext copy (all thanks to the fine folks at Google, I assume) is here for posterity.

<p style="text-align: center;">THE FIRST SHOT ON FORT SUMTER<br />
By Robert Lebby (1833-1910), M. D.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The following paper was prepared about 1893, by the late Dr.  Robert Lebby, for many years quarantine officer of the State of South  Carolina at the port of Charleston, and by him given in 1906 to Mr. A.  S. Salley, Jr., Secretary of the Historical Commission of South  Carolina, for permanent preservation by the publication thereof. Mr.  Salley permitted The News and Courier to print it in its issue of  Monday, September 3, 1906, and presents it here for the twofold purpose  of preserving a most conclusive presentation of evidence regarding the  firing of the first hostile shot on Fort Sumter and of carrying out his  promise to Dr. Lebby to have the paper published in permanent form.<br />
April 12, 1893, will be the thirty-​second anniversary of the first  shell fired at Fort Sumter, and is generally considered as the opening  of the terrible struggle between the Northern and Southern sections of  this great country—the one ostensibly for the preservation of the Union  of these United States; the other for the maintenance of their rights  under the Constitution of that Union, which they felt were being wrested  from them by a fanatical element at the North.<br />
Much has been  written to prove the particular individual who fired the first shell at  Fort Sumter, and thereby establish the fact of a questionable honor of  having inaugurated the most momentous struggle in the history of the  world, both as to its duration and the numbers engaged in it, and the  tenacity with which those of the weaker section maintained themselves  against those of the stronger, with the<br />
3<br />
whole of Europe to recruit their armies from and all the resources which their open ports afforded.<br />
I purpose, as a witness to this opening episode in the great  drama, beginning April 12, 1861, to give my recollection of it, along  with that of others who were on the historic spot of Fort Johnson at  that time, as there are but a few now left who were there and witnessed  what took place thirty-​two years ago, in order that when the history of  this gigantic struggle may be written in after years, some items may be  obtained that will assist in its compilation.<br />
In order that  one not present on the spot may understand the situation of affairs at  Fort Johnson at that time, I will state that there were two mortar  batteries erected at Fort Johnson for the reduction of Fort Sumter. One  situated on the front beach, midway between old Fort Johnson and the  Lazaretto point, and directly west of Fort Sumter, and known as the  beach, or east, battery (This was the most vulnerable and the weakest  line of Fort Sumter), and the other was located due northwest of the  former on a hill near some houses and contiguous to the present  quarantine residence. The remains of this battery are still plainly  visible. It was knOwn as the hill, or west, battery. The east, or beach,  battery has been washed away by the sea, but I have saved the timber  that was used in the construction of the magazine. This comprises the  topography of the offensive works at Fort Johnson for the reduction of  Sumter on April 12, 1861.<br />
The post of Fort Johnson consisted,  at that date, of these two batteries of mortars and a company of  infantry as reserves, all under command of Captain George S. James,  South Carolina State troops.<br />
The battery on the beach, or east, was  under the immediate command of Captain James, with Lieutenant Henry S.  Farley as lieutenant, and the battery on the hill, or west, was under  the immediate command of Lieutenant Wade Hampton Gibbes, I think with  Lieutenant J. McPherson Washington as next, and the company of infantry,  as reserves, was commanded by Lieutenant Theodore B. Hayne, and was  stationed near the old Martello Tower, about 400<br />
yards in the woods, to the northwest of the hill, or Gibbes, battery.<br />
I have been thus particular in the location of the battery and its  officers for reasons that will be apparent hereafter, and they are  facts that cannot be contradicted.<br />
The first point to be established is from what battery was the first mortar shell fired?<br />
General Beauregard, Military Operations, page 42, chapter 4, last paragraph, says:<br />
From Fort Johnson&#8217;s mortar battery at 4.30, A. M.,issued the first  shell of the war. It was fired not by Mr. Ruffin, of Virginia, as has  been erroneously supposed1, but by Capt. George S. James, of South  Carolina, to whom Lieut. Stephen D. Lee issued the order.<br />
Captain Stephen D. Lee, an aide of General Beauregard&#8217;s, and who, with  Gen. Chesnut, informed Major Anderson that fire would be opened on Fort  Sumter, says:<br />
The first fire was from James&#8217;s battery.2<br />
Mr. Edward H. Barnwell, of Charleston, who was present at Gibbes&#8217;s battery at the opening, says:<br />
The first shell fired at Sumter was from James&#8217;s east battery (or  the beach battery); the second was from the west (or hill battery). I  was at this battery among some houses, one of which our forces tried to  blow up, being too near the battery (Greer&#8217;s house). This was the  battery under command of Lieut. W. H. Gibbes.<br />
Dr. W. H. Prioleau, surgeon of the post, who was at the east, or beach, battery when the first shell was fired, states:<br />
On the morning of April 12, 1861, as soon as orders were received  to open fire on Fort Sumter, we repaired to our posts, and twentyfive or  thirty minutes after 4, A. M., by my watch, which I held open in my  hand at the time, the first gun was fired, this being the right-​hand  mortar in the battery on the beach. I cannot recollect who pulled the  lanyard, but this gun was directly in charge of Lieutenant Henry S.  Farley, who, as well as I can recollect, sighted the gun. Captain James  giving the order to fire.&#8217;<br />
1“The venerable Edmund Ruffin, who,  as soon as it was known a battle was inevitable, hastened over to  Morris&#8217; Island and was elected a member of the Palmetto Guard, fired the  first gun from Stevens&#8217; Iron Battery. All honor to the chivalric  Virginian! May he live many years to wear the fadeless wreath that honor  placed upon his brow on our glorious Friday.”—The Charleston Daily  Courier, Saturday, April 13, 1861. (Note by A. S. S., Jr.)<br />
2Vide Southern Historical Society Papers, November 1883, and other papers of Gen. Lee.<br />
&#8220;Note this evidence.<br />
Colonel Henry S. Farley, now of Mount Pleasant Military Academy,  Sing Sing, New York, who was a lieutenant with James in the beach  battery, states in a letter to me:<br />
The circumstances attending  the firing of the first gun at Sumter are q•uite fresh in my memory.  Captain James stood on my right, with watch in hand, and at the  designated moment gave me the order to fire. I pulled the lanyard,  having already carefully inserted a friction tube, and discharged a  thirteen-​inch mortar shell, which was the right of battery. In one of  the issues of a Charleston evening paper, which appeared shortly after  the reduction of Fort Sumter, you will find it stated that Lieutenant  Farley fired the first gun, and Lieutenant Gibbes the second.4<br />
I  will now give my personal recollections of the affair. I am a native,  and was a resident and practicing physician of James&#8217; Island at the time  the first gun was fired, and consequently was perfectly conversant with  the topography of the location, and having been a college acquaintance  of Captain James, was invited by him the previous day, April 11, to be  on hand if anything transpired to require my services. I accepted his  invitation and remained to witness the first, and last, gun fired at  Sumter at that time.<br />
My recollection of the matter is that on  the morning of April 12, 1861, about ten minutes before 4, A. M.,  Captain S. D. Lee, with two other gentlemen, having just returned from  Sumter, passed a group of four gentlemen, I among the number, and  inquired for Captain James&#8217;s quarters, and when directed to the house  occupied by Captain James, remarked on passing, that the ball would soon  be opened.<br />
A short time elapsed, when Captain James and others  passed to the beach, or east, battery, and Captain Lee and his party  went on down to the wharf. I was midway between the houses on a bridge  that connected the beach and the hill, where I could see the fire of  either battery, and at</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;At thirty minutes past four  o&#8217;clock the conflict was opened by the discharge of a shell from the  Howitzer Battery on James&#8217; Island, under the command of Captain GEO. S.  JAMES, who followed the riddled Palmetto banner on the bloody battle  fields of Mexico.<br />
&#8220;The sending of this harmful messenger to  Major Anderson was followed by a deafening explosion, which was caused  by the blowing up of a building that stood in front of the battery.<br />
“While the white smoke was melting away into the air another shell,  which Lieut. W. HAMPTON GIBBES has the honor of having fired, pursued  its noiseless way toward the hostile fortification.”—The Charleston  Daily Courier, Saturday, April 13, 1861. (Note by A. S. S., Jr.)<br />
4:30, A. M., a shell was fired from the beach, or east, battery, commanded by Captain James.<br />
The second report heard was the blowing up of Greer&#8217;s house,  contiguous to the hill battery, commanded by Lieutenant W. H. Gibbes,  and the second shell was fired from this battery under Lieutenant  Gibbes. The firing then became general around the harbor batteries  bearing on Sumter.<br />
We have, therefore, the concurrent testimony  of General Beauregard, who ordered the fire to commence; of Captain  Stephen D. Lee, the officer extending the order; of Lieutenant Farley,  who was in the battery when the gun was fired, and of the medical  officer, Dr. W. H. Prioleau, who was on duty in the battery; also of  Lieutenant Edward H. Barnwell, who was present at the hill, or Gibbes,  battery, and of myself, who all bear witness to the fact that the first  shell was fired from Captain James&#8217;s battery on the beach. How, then,  can anyone claim that the shell was fired from any other point with this  weight of evidence against it?<br />
As to the question of who  pulled the lanyard of the mortar from which issued the first shell,  there are only two living witnesses that I am cognizant of who were in  the battery at the time of the fire, viz: Colonel Henry S. Farley and  Dr. W. H. Prioleau. Colonel Henry S. Farley asserts in a letter to me  that he pulled the lanyard by Captain James&#8217;s order, and Dr. Prioleau  asserts that Lieutenant Farley had charge of the right gun of the  battery, and that the first fire was from that gun, Captain James giving  the order to fire, and it is reasonable to conclude, therefore, that  Farley pulled the lanyard. Certain it is that either James or Farley  fired it, but, as Captain James gave the order to fire, it must have  been Farley, as James would never have given himself the order to fire.  The order, therefore, must have been given to Farley. I, therefore,  conclude that Lieutenant Henry S. Farley fired the first gun at Sumter  by Captain James&#8217;s order.</p></blockquote>
