				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>These are some deliciously tasty scones that are incredibly easy to make. The recipe is from a former cowoker, Ryan. They just take a few minutes and aren&#8217;t messy or anything. We often substitute out up to half the flour with whole wheat. Presumably healthier and gives a nice flavor.  It can fairly easily scale up or down (we usually make a half recipe for 2 people).</p>
<p>Scones, makes about a dozen.</p>
<p>Dry Ingredients:</p>
<ul>
<li> 2 cups flour (up to half whole wheat, if you want)</li>
<li>1/3 cup white sugar</li>
<li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
</ul>
<p>Add 1 &amp; 1/4 cups cream.</p>
<p>Mix with a fork until it forms a loose mass. Mold it into shape by hand, but be careful not to overmix.</p>
<p>Bake at 425 F until lightly brown on top and it passes the toothpick test. In a proper oven this is usually around 15 min. In a toaster oven it might be more like 20.</p>
