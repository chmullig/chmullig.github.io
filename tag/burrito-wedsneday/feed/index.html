				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve decided that the time has arrived for the establishment of a new tradition in our great lands: Burrito Wednesday. Everyone agrees that burritos are a delicious and amazing food.</p>
<p><strong>What, wait, why? <span style="font-weight: normal;">The concept is delightful in its simplicity. Every Wednesday you should go out in search of a <em>new</em> burrito to try. Ideally these would be entirely new locations, but for my purpose I&#8217;m going with a &#8220;no repeats&#8221; model, where places I&#8217;ve been too before are fine, as long as it hasn&#8217;t been the featured Burrito Wednesday candidate. Why Wednesday? For one, it&#8217;s a shitty day of the week and a nice burrito institution would liven it up. For another, I don&#8217;t have any standing meetings around lunch time on Wednesday, like I do on most of the other days of the week.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-weight: normal;">Please join me (either in a literal, have a burrito at the same table sense or metaphorically) in this new tradition. If Wednesday is bad for you, heck, make it Burrito Monday. Why not? I&#8217;ll be maybe posting here about the burritos I consume</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Week #1: June 2nd, 2010</strong> <strong>Chipotle Dupont Circle</strong></p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="IMG_1627.JPG" src="http://chmullig.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/IMG_1627.jpg" border="0" alt="Chipotle Dupont Circle" width="320" height="240" /></p>
<p>I started off with a close, convenient location &#8211; <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/place?cid=10859492195812603957&amp;q=chipotle+1629+Connecticut+Ave+NW&amp;cd=1&amp;ei=xrwGTP-MIpyijQOlgqXNCA&amp;dtab=0&amp;sll=38.911538,-77.044384&amp;sspn=0.006295,0.006295&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=38.916682,-77.053127&amp;spn=0,0&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=A">Chipotle Dupont Circle</a>. Yes, you might assume you&#8217;ve been to Chipotle and know all there is to know. However this branch has a surprise in store &#8211; it features the delicious vegan Garden Blend. A fake meat product, it&#8217;s quite tasty and rare. This is the pilot location for the stuff, so it&#8217;s not quite your regular Chipotle fare. Today I got a burrito with rice, peppers &amp; onions, black beans, garden blend, salsa fresca, tomatilla hot sauce and cheese. I intended to toss corn &amp; lettuce on there, but screwed up. The total came to $6.71 with tax.</p>
<p>The burrito itself was rather tasty. The lack of veggies was a bit of a disappointment, and the hot sauce wasn&#8217;t too exciting. The second half sorta dragged on, without much to keep me engaged. Overall it was big, and tasty. Without the garden blend I&#8217;m not sure I would have cared much, but the garden blend is unique and interesting. I highly recommend it. I&#8217;d rate it about 3 stars on my meaningless and uncalibrated scale.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="IMG_1626.jpg" src="http://chmullig.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/IMG_1626.jpg" border="0" alt="Partial Burrito Love" width="240" height="320" /></p>
<p>In upcoming weeks I hope to feature all my regular burrito spots, and expand to some new ones. Pedro &amp; Vinny&#8217;s, CalTort, The Well Dressed Burrito, Baja Fresh, Qdoba, Pica Taco, the 17th st cart and a bunch of others. However I&#8217;d love suggestions of places to try out that are within reasonable transit distance of Dupont Circle/Downtown DC. Happy burritoing.</p>
