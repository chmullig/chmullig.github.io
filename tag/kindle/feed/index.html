				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I suffer, as I&#8217;m sure many internet overusers do, with a bit of ADD. When browsing the internet I&#8217;ll often stumble across articles in the 2000-10,000 word range. They&#8217;re interesting, but they&#8217;re not what I need now. In the past I&#8217;d tend to leave them open in a tab for a few days or weeks, maybe bookmark them, but generally just forget them.</p>
<p>A while ago I heard about Instapaper &#8211; a tool that was supposed to solve that.  I could save articles and they&#8217;d go into Instapaper, where I could read them later at my leisure. Instapaper would also strip out some of the extraneous shit on the internet and make the articles more readable. After a few days I realized I would never actually go back to the instapaper site to read them, so I sort of gave up. I installed the iPhone app, but that wasn&#8217;t quite right either.</p>
<p>Then a few weeks ago I discovered that Instapaper can now <a href="http://www.instapaper.com/extras">push articles to Kindle</a>!</p>
<div id="attachment_347" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://chmullig.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/IMG_2445.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-347" title="Instapaper on my Kindle" src="http://chmullig.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/IMG_2445-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Instapaper on my Kindle. This is the most useful article overview for me.</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It turns out this is the perfect delivery mechanism for me. The articles I Instapaper aren&#8217;t time sensitive, and they&#8217;re long enough that I strongly prefer the digital screen. With WiFi the articles are delivered free, generally a day or two after I hit the button in the browser without me having to do anything else. Click, wait, read on kindle. This is fine, and means there are often little surprises for me.</p>
<p>Instapaper is well integrated into other parts of my life, namely Twitter for iPhone. I&#8217;m rarely interested in reading a whole article in iPhone twitter, but I often am curious to read more. I just hit the Instapaper button and it syncs over, easy as pie.</p>
<p>I strongly encourage anyone else who&#8217;s found it hard to sink your teeth into a good article online to try out the Instapaper + Kindle delivery option. It really legitimizes longer form content on the web.</p>
