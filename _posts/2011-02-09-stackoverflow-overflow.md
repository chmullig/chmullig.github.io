Recently [I&#8217;ve][1] gotten a bit obsessed with [stackoverflow.com][2]. It&#8217;s a programming Q&A site. You can ask questions, you can answer and comment on them. However they have a sick twist &#8211; people vote on everything. They vote on your questions, answers, comments. You earn reputation points when your content is voted up, and you lose points when it&#8217;s voted down. You also earn badges, like gaming achievements.

They&#8217;ve recently started a whole bunch of related sites under the [stackexchange][3] brand. Same model and software, but with different subjects. So far there are already [more than I care to count][4] with only very spurious differentiation, but a few highlights include [gaming][5], [cooking][6], [english][7], [programming][8] (as a profession), [power users][9], [sysadmin][10], [linux][11], [ubuntu][12], and a lot more.

Here&#8217;s my badge of honor. Right now I have 674 rep and 10 badges on Stackoverflow, and 261/4 on gaming (plus ~100 on a bunch of the other sites, just for signing up). That&#8217;s my profile image, which should update automatically!

It&#8217;s amazing how satisfying and competitive the Q&A system ends up. I find myself less and less interested in any other medium for asking or answering questions like the kind on Stackoverflow. It&#8217;s slow and there&#8217;s no rep, what&#8217;s the point?
