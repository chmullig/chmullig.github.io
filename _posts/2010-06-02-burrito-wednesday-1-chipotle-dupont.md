I&#8217;ve decided that the time has arrived for the establishment of a new tradition in our great lands: Burrito Wednesday. Everyone agrees that burritos are a delicious and amazing food.

**What, wait, why?Â <span style="font-weight: normal;">The concept is delightful in its simplicity. Every Wednesday you should go out in search of a <em>new</em> burrito to try. Ideally these would be entirely new locations, but for my purpose I&#8217;m going with a &#8220;no repeats&#8221; model, where places I&#8217;ve been too before are fine, as long as it hasn&#8217;t been the featured Burrito Wednesday candidate. Why Wednesday? For one, it&#8217;s a shitty day of the week and a nice burrito institution would liven it up. For another, I don&#8217;t have any standing meetings around lunch time on Wednesday, like I do on most of the other days of the week.</span>**

**<span style="font-weight: normal;">Please join me (either in a literal, have a burrito at the same table sense or metaphorically) in this new tradition. If Wednesday is bad for you, heck, make it Burrito Monday. Why not? I&#8217;ll be maybe posting here about the burritos I consume</span>**

**Week #1: June 2nd, 2010** **Chipotle Dupont Circle**

I started off with a close, convenient location &#8211; [Chipotle Dupont Circle][1]. Yes, you might assume you&#8217;ve been to Chipotle and know all there is to know. However this branch has a surprise in store &#8211; it features the delicious vegan Garden Blend. A fake meat product, it&#8217;s quite tasty and rare. This is the pilot location for the stuff, so it&#8217;s not quite your regular Chipotle fare. Today I got a burrito with rice, peppers & onions, black beans, garden blend, salsa fresca, tomatilla hot sauce and cheese. I intended to toss corn & lettuce on there, but screwed up. The total came to $6.71 with tax.

The burrito itself was rather tasty. The lack of veggies was a bit of a disappointment, and the hot sauce wasn&#8217;t too exciting. The second half sorta dragged on, without much to keep me engaged. Overall it was big, and tasty. Without the garden blend I&#8217;m not sure I would have cared much, but the garden blend is unique and interesting. I highly recommend it. I&#8217;d rate it about 3 stars on my meaningless and uncalibrated scale.

In upcoming weeks I hope to feature all my regular burrito spots, and expand to some new ones. Pedro & Vinny&#8217;s, CalTort, The Well Dressed Burrito, Baja Fresh, Qdoba, Pica Taco, the 17th st cart and a bunch of others. However I&#8217;d love suggestions of places to try out that are within reasonable transit distance of Dupont Circle/Downtown DC. Happy burritoing.
