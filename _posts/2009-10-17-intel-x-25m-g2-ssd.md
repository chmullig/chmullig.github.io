**I&#8217;ve since updated some of this with a controller based RAID0 of the intel drives, as well as a RAID1 of Western Digital RE3 1TB drives.**

At work we&#8217;re upgrading a linux server for a specific project. We&#8217;re replacing it&#8217;s pair of 150GB Western Digital Raptors in RAID1 with 2x 1TB in RAID1 and **2 Intel X-25M G2 **Solid State Disks in RAID0. This software has always had issues with slow random seeks. We tried using 32GB flash drives for a similar problem, but even top of the line CF disks just weren&#8217;t fast enough.

The drives arrived today, and they look amazing. I did three fairly simple performance tests. The server has 2 Intel X5355 Xeon CPUs, for 8 cores at 2.66GHz and 32GB of RAM. /dev/sda is a 250GB Maxtor DiamondMax 10. /dev/sdb is the pair of 150GB VelociRaptors in a RAID1. /dev/sdc is the Intel X25M. I haven&#8217;t installed the second Intel yet. I also haven&#8217;t tweaked the settings at all, so I&#8217;m not positive NCQ and AHCI are enabled for the best performance. It&#8217;s also an older kernel, 2.6.20 on an older ubuntu. I&#8217;m using ext3, while I understand ext4 will provide some performance increases.

I ran three different benchmarks on the drives. First was a basic hdparm -tT to compare raw disk reads. The SSD was 3 times faster than the Raptor. Second was the postmark utility, which is supposed to be representative of a mail server workload. I&#8217;m slightly skeptical, but it appears the SSD was 3-4 times faster. Finally I ran bonnie++, with 63GB files. I only did it on the Raptor and SSD due to time, but the SSD was 2.2-4x faster for transfer speeds. The crazy part is bonnie++ says the SSD could do 47 times more seeks per second than the raptor. I fully admit I&#8217;m not familiar with bonnie or postmark, so if anyone has suggestions on other settings to use, please let me know.

Below are the raw results and commands I used to generate the info, in case anyone is curious.

hdparm results

<pre>chris@gore:~$ sudo hdparm -tT /dev/sda /dev/sdb /dev/sdc
/dev/sda: #Maxtor 250GB
Timing cached reads:   6020 MB in  2.00 seconds = 3011.94 MB/sec
Timing buffered disk reads:  202 MB in  3.00 seconds =  67.30 MB/sec

/dev/sdb: #Raptor RAID1
Timing cached reads:   6172 MB in  2.00 seconds = 3087.55 MB/sec
Timing buffered disk reads:  244 MB in  3.02 seconds =  80.88 MB/sec

/dev/sdc: #Intel X25M
Timing cached reads:   6164 MB in  2.00 seconds = 3083.54 MB/sec
Timing buffered disk reads:  730 MB in  3.00 seconds = 243.09 MB/sec</pre>
