For my own curiosity I created a python + R script to grab the MITRE leaderboard and graph it. It&#8217;s a [bit of python][1] to grab the leaderboard and write out some CSVs.Â Then a bit of <strike>[R code][2]</strike> (updated link: <http://a.libpa.st/4KFGq>) generates the graph. It&#8217;s running automatically with launchd on my laptop, and it should be regularly uploading a png to the address below. Launchd is pretty awesome, but a royal pain in the ass to get set up. It doesn&#8217;t feel very deterministic.

I still need to figure out how to jitter the names so they don&#8217;t overlap (like YouGov & Agent Smith), but other than that I thought it was a nifty little exercise.
