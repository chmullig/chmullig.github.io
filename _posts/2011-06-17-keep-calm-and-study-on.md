Playing around today, I came upon an obvious/clever idea. A bit of hacking in [Inkscape][1] led to this. Note the crown, font and colors (don&#8217;t sue me, Trustees!)&#8230;

<div id="attachment_373" style="width: 471px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">
  <a href="http://chmullig.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/keep-calm-and-study-on-poster.pdf"><img class="size-full wp-image-373 " title="Keep Calm and Study On" src="http://chmullig.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/keep-calm-and-study-on-poster_768x1147.png" alt="" width="461" height="688" /></a>
  
  <p class="wp-caption-text">
    Keep Calm and Study On
  </p>
</div>

For those interested I&#8217;ve uploaded [PDF][2] (if you want to print or have a larger copy or something) and [SVG][3] (if you want to modify) files. It&#8217;s in the original size/aspect ratio for the Keep Calm and Carry On posters, 19¾ x 29½. Anyone is welcome to use it &#8211; if you&#8217;re feeling generous you&#8217;re welcome to cite me.
