I&#8217;m a fan of puzzles, programming and learning, so I&#8217;ve always enjoyed [The Python Challenges][1]. Recently my coworkers Delia, Chris and I came up with the idea of doing some of those within the company to help ourselves and our coworkers become more familiar with Python and R (and to a lesser extent SQL and other languages).

The end result is the [YG Challenge][2], where we&#8217;ll be posting a few problems a week in at least R & Python, then solving them. Week 1 is up, and we have some great ideas for the future. Intended for our coworkers, it&#8217;s public because why not! Feel free to take a stab at solving them, especially if you haven&#8217;t used either of those languages before.
