These are some deliciously tasty scones that are incredibly easy to make. The recipe is from a former cowoker, Ryan. They just take a few minutes and aren&#8217;t messy or anything. We often substitute out up to half the flour with whole wheat. Presumably healthier and gives a nice flavor.Â  It can fairly easily scale up or down (we usually make a half recipe for 2 people).

Scones, makes about a dozen.

Dry Ingredients:

  * 2 cups flour (up to half whole wheat, if you want)
  * 1/3 cup white sugar
  * 1 tablespoon baking powder
  * 1/2 teaspoon salt

Add 1 & 1/4 cups cream.

Mix with a fork until it forms a loose mass. Mold it into shape by hand, but be careful not to overmix.

Bake at 425 F until lightly brown on top and it passes the toothpick test. In a proper oven this is usually around 15 min. In a toaster oven it might be more like 20.
