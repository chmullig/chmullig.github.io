**Burrito Wednesday #5 â€” [Tomatillo][1] [Taqueria][2] at The Big Hunt. **

This was a suggestion from Marian and her coworker, and I&#8217;m very glad I listened. Thanks, ladies! It&#8217;s a bit of hike from the office, but I think it ended up being worth the trip.

During the day the big hunt rents the window of their bar out to these guys to sell burritos and taco. There&#8217;s no seating or anything, just a big open window at counter height. Two guys in there pumping out tasty, comparatively authentic seeming dishes. They branded it pretty well, with signs and menus and such. It didn&#8217;t seem nearly as odd as I expected, which was nice. They get bonus points for simple pricing, and it looked like the tacos came in more traditional corn tortillas &#8211; awesome.

The veggie burrito was solid &#8211; rice, black beans, some sort of stewed green peppers & onions, and guacamole. I added salsa fresca, tomatillo salsa, lettuce and cheese. The cheese was nice, perhaps Panela but maybe something else. They turned them out pretty quickly, and it came to $6.

The burrito looked tasty, but wasn&#8217;t especially hot. There was no seating there, and I incorrectly decided to walk back to the office instead of going to the park. By the time I got back to the office with my burrito it was merely lukewarm. I dug in and it was tasty, but overall the luke-warmness was a big let down. All my fault, but sad none the less. I&#8217;ll have to go back and eat one straight away.

I was digging in and enjoying it so much I nearly forgot to take a picture, that&#8217;s the only one I got. Mmmm. The ingredients were well distributed and nothing especially stood out for good or bad. It was well made and consistent. It was definitely on the smaller side, and probably much healthier than the others I&#8217;ve reviewed. However it made me wish I had a few chips and some salsa to go along with it.

I&#8217;d rate it a 3 on the arbitrary scale.
