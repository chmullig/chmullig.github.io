**Burrito Wednesday Week #3: June 16, 2010 â€” [The Burrito and Coffee Cart][1].**

A [mere two blocks away][2] from from [Pedro & Vinny&#8217;s][3] cart is another burrito cart. Back in 2004 I&#8217;d occasionally grab a latte here on the way into the office. I got a burrito once or twice, and was pretty disappointed. Since then I&#8217;ve stuck with Pedro & Vinny. However, for the cause of Burrito Wednesdays we must push outside of our comfort zones.

Carlos isn&#8217;t as personable or friendly as John. The ordering was much more difficult &#8211; he made assumptions and didn&#8217;t really ask what exactly I wanted. I ended up with, basically &#8211; spinach tortilla, rice, black beans, cheese, a bit of boring salsa, guac and some Cholula. It was something around $6.

Unfortunately it wasn&#8217;t very good. The tortilla was fine. The cheese was very nicely melted and it was well distributed throughout. The guacamole was definitely the highlight, but it was just from a cosco tub. Frankly, I was hoping from something a bit more unique. The beans and rice were just terribly bland and boring. I didn&#8217;t particularly want to finish it, not because of volume but because it was boring. I really can&#8217;t see coming back when the fundamental ingredients don&#8217;t hold any interest. I give some credit that it was very tidy &#8211; unfortunately it was too tidy. Too buttoned up. Too blah.

Sadly it doesn&#8217;t score better than 1 on the arbitrary & meaningless scale.
