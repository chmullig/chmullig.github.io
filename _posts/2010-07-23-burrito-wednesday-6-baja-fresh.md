**Burrito Wednesday #6 &#8211;[ Baja Fresh][1]**

Hit and run since this is a couple weeks late now, oops! My coworker [Jaraco][2] was headed here for the green salsa (being a New Mexico boy, that&#8217;s important for him I suppose) so I bumped it up the list and joined him.

I haveÂ  mixed feelings about Baja Fresh. The ingredients are all fairly high quality, they build them well enough, but it doesn&#8217;t gel into a great experience for me. I think the biggest issue I have is that the cold ingredients like pico de gallo and sour cream really cool the whole thing down, so you don&#8217;t have the enjoyment of nice hot beans, rice and veggies. The variety of hot sauces and salsas definitely give bonus points, and it&#8217;s not too expensive.

    Overall I&#8217;d probably say it&#8217;s a 2 on my scale, good, but with some drawbacks.
