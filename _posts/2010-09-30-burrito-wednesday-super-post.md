I&#8217;ve been very, very bad about posting recent burrito wednesdays. Luckily I&#8217;ve still been doing it nearly every week (missed a few while traveling). I&#8217;m going to just post &#8217;em here en masse and then hopefully get back on schedule.

# Burrito Wednesday #9: Food Chain

[Food Chain][1] is a collaboration between some clever guy and a bunch of existing vendors to provide better food out of the carts. He preps it, and they sell it ala franchises. This is a cart down near 17th and Connecticut. They technically call it a wrap, and I don&#8217;t recall being especially impressed by it. The sauce was pretty good, but the rest was pretty meh. Not much too it, rice, beans and not a whole lot else. Overall maybe 2 stars?

# Burrito Wednesday #10: California Tortilla

[Cal Tort][2] is one of my favorites, especially after I [won 52 free burritos][3]. Unfortunately I didn&#8217;t give them a fair shake for Burrito Wednesday &#8211; going to an out of the way spot (College Park) at an off time (early on a quiet summer weekday). They weren&#8217;t there best, but still pretty tasty. I really dig the new No Meato Burrito with cheese. It has a nice sauce. One of the real highlights of CalTort is the impressive hot sauce selection &#8211; including Brian&#8217;s favorite Dave&#8217;s Insanity &#8211; which will burn you. Burn you good. Overall still one of the best ones &#8211; 3.5 stars? 4? I don&#8217;t even remember my scale anymore.

*I missed the next Burrito Wednesday because I was on vacation, and the [best/only burrito place][4] I could find was closed on Wednesdays. D&#8217;oh!*

# Burrito Wednesday #11: Sancho&#8217;s Taqueria

I was in Palo Alto that week, so I went [out][5] [with][6] a [huge][7] [cohort][8] of [coworkers][9] to [Sancho&#8217;s Taqueria][10]. Unfortunately I didn&#8217;t take any pics. However the burrito was delicious. [Chris][11] is a fan of of the no veggie, no meat one, but I found the veggies to be delectable. They also had some tasty sauces you could take away. Bravo! 4 stars?

# Burrito Wednesday #12: Taco Bell

Why I did this, I don&#8217;t really know. It was close, and I didn&#8217;t have many other close options left. Still&#8230;. I got a single bean burrito. It was shockingly cheap ($0.99 maybe?), and shockingly bad. It tasted overwhelming of salt. It wasn&#8217;t very large, and was pretty pathetically bad. Ugh. 1 star, at best. I&#8217;m glad to confirm there&#8217;s a reason I avoid this place.

    Being a combination Taco Bell/KFC is really not appealing to me at all. Ugh.

# Burrito Wednesday #13: Qdoba

I wanted to like this place, since a few friends rave about it. However I was quite disappointed. One point in there favor was that I had been to the dentist that morning &#8211; so perhaps my mouth was extra sensitive? I didn&#8217;t notice anything at breakfast, but maybe this was different?

The staff was pretty rude. After I agreed to pay extra for veggies they only put a small scooping on. I asked for more, and they were annoyed. I think a manager saw I was peeved and stepped in, which definitely improved the situation. Â The burrito was large and moderately priced. Unfortunately I found the texture to be incredibly off putting. The peppers were slightly bitter and had a very odd and inconsistent crunch to them. The rice was occasionally pretty hard. In the end I couldn&#8217;t finish it, and left feeling pretty disappointed. Still much better than taco bell, and again perhaps another location/time would be better. Overall no more than 2 stars.

    Qdoba looks tasty, don't it?

*I missed the next 2 weeks due to being in Europe. I&#8217;m sure I could have gotten tasty burritos in Amsterdam at least, but I was more interested in trying the local cuisines.*

# Burrito Wednesday #14: Mixtec

Back in the US it was time for another Burrito Wednesday. I [grabbed a bike][12] and headed up to Adam&#8217;s Morgan for [Mixtec][13]. Somewhat unusually I ate it there. The burrito was quite large and pretty good. It had 2 sauces, plus some hot sauces they put on the side. The guac and pico de gallo on the plate were a nice compliment. My biggest complaint was that it was a ton of tortilla, especially toward the end. I ended up leaving a lot of tortilla on the plate, after removing the inners. Overall it was better than I expected &#8211; 3 stars?

As an aside, the bike rental worked really well. I think I&#8217;ll sign up for a $50 yearly membership and try it out.
