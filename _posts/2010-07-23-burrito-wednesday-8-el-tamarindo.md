**Burrito Wednesday #8 &#8211; [El Tamarindo][1]**

This is more like [Casa Blanco][2] in that it&#8217;s a sit down place with the carryout containers, rather than a wrapped lunch spot. I was expecting a pretty traditional burrito, but in some ways I think it was the most off the wall one I&#8217;ve had so far. I ordered the veggie, and it was pretty expensive at ~$12.

It was too large, with too much tortilla (it seriously seemed like an 18&#8243; tortilla!) and not enough tomatillo sauce. Ended up being pretty dry. The contents were crazy and included *cucumber*, carrots, corn and more. They gave a giant mound of sour cream on the side, along with an orange wedge. Ok&#8230;. I like vegetables, even weird ones (I like Well Dressed and Cal Tort&#8217;s new burrito for example) but this one wasn&#8217;t doing it for me. I&#8217;ll say a 1 on the meaningless scale.
