		<description><![CDATA[Good review. 

I was in a similar boat; Working from home, which is a small condo. We looked around, and found the StudioDesk at a couple of stores and really liked it. The store would order a dozen every two weeks, and they would go in a couple of days. They always have a waiting list for the desk.

Despite some it&#039;s shortcomings (price being the most obvious), I love the desk. I think it&#039;s great. I run a cinema display and a macbook pro, and it looks and works great. I don&#039;t mind the faux leather - obviously real leather would be nice, but in the end, it&#039;s functional, helps keep the clutter to a minimum, and I&#039;m my opinion, looks great.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I was considering this along with the &quot;one less desk&quot; by Heckler Design.  Having seen the actual construction of this jobby, I&#039;ll definitely be going with Heckler, which you might consider, btw.  For the just about the same price (in Canada at least), it seems like a much more solid investment.  Thanks for the review!]]></description>
