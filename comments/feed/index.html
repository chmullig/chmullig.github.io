		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m interested in how mid september numbers  delay the drop in births.  I&#039;m of the opinion that the changes over holidays and particularly in september are related to planned births where doctors coming back to work are more likely to plan c-sections during that period.  Weekends and weekday numbers may also affect this, although across years this should average out.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This graph has a clear high frequency cycle with a period of about one week.  If the data were from only one year then this could be explained by day of the week skew.  But since it is averaged across 50 years, each day of the month should fall roughly the same number of times on each day of the week.

Do you have any explanation for this cycle?]]></description>
