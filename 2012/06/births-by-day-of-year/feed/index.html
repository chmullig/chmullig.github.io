		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m interested in how mid september numbers  delay the drop in births.  I&#039;m of the opinion that the changes over holidays and particularly in september are related to planned births where doctors coming back to work are more likely to plan c-sections during that period.  Weekends and weekday numbers may also affect this, although across years this should average out.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This graph has a clear high frequency cycle with a period of about one week.  If the data were from only one year then this could be explained by day of the week skew.  But since it is averaged across 50 years, each day of the month should fall roughly the same number of times on each day of the week.

Do you have any explanation for this cycle?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Correct, it&#039;s strictly US data.

Of course there are all sorts of minor ambiguities, many of which changed over time. Things like how you account for tourists? What about a Canadian who&#039;s here for college?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;d really love to find better data. I think the CA birth database has 1960-2010, but it&#039;s $200/year. 

They also have death files for 1970-2010, but that&#039;s ~$150/year.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Fascinating graph!

1) Since births peak in summer, it&#039;s clear that the practice of starting all brand new residents on July 1 is extremely unfortunate.

2)It would be really interesting to see how this graph has changed in recent years, because tax incentives for giving birth before midnight on 12/31 have greatly increased since 1988, due to the expansion of the Earned Income Credit as part of the mid-1990&#039;s welfare reform and then subsequent increases in the child tax credit over the past decade.  For some parents, giving birth on 12/31 will increase their tax refund (federal and state combined) by $5,000, and electronic tax administration means that they can get that money within a month of giving birth.  

See:  Stacy Dickert-Conlin &amp; Amitabh Chandra, Taxes and the Timing of Births, 107 J. Pol. Econ. 161 (1999)
Also, Teny Maghakian and Lisa Schulkind have a working paper with more recent data

Also, of course, the rate of C-sections has grown considerably in recent decades, so it would be really interesting to see the change graphically.]]></description>
